## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Red is power, brown is ground and orange is signal.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

It should be connected to PIN 9.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The “pos” variable controls the angle of the Servo. The absolute value of the argument for the "pos" function controls position, while the step size in the for loop controls the rate of change of the position (angular velocity).

## Part C. Integrating input and output
